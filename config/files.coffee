# Exports an object that defines
#    all of the paths & globs that the project
#    is concerned with.
#
#   The "configure" task will require this file and
#    then re-initialize the grunt config such that
#    directives like <config:files.js.app> will work
#    regardless of the point you're at in the build
#    lifecycle.
#
#   To see the default definitions for all of Lineman's file paths and globs, look at:
#   https://github.com/testdouble/lineman/blob/master/config/files.coffee
